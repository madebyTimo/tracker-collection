<summary>But such a channel already exists. Why this one?</summary>

The Channel 
[@lineageos_updates](https://t.me/lineageos_updates) 
by 
[SebaUbuntu](https://github.com/SebaUbuntu) 
seems to go down sometimes.
I know this isn't some absolutely vital information, 
I just thought I could achieve higher availability
and also condense the provided information
and user interface better.
